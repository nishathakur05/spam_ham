# Spam and Ham Message Classification

This project focuses on building a text classification system to identify spam and ham (non-spam) messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniques.

The workflow includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. Multiple machine learning models were implemented and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Model performance was assessed using standard classification metrics to compare their effectiveness.
